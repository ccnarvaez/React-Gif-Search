# Searching gifs

This project was part of the practice due to the Udemy course "React de cero a experto" by Fernando Herrera. Basically, the main purpose was dealing with react components and fetching API data.

# How does it works?

It is pretty simple, just write something in the search bar and then some gifs will be printed on!
